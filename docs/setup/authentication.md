# Authentication Setup

This guide explains how to connect your **Shopware 6** store to **n8n** using the **Shopware Integration credentials**.  
Once configured, the node can securely perform operations on products, customers, and orders through the Shopware Admin API.

---

## Overview

The Shopware 6 node uses **Client Credentials authentication**, which requires an **Integration** in your Shopware Admin panel.  
This provides three essential parameters:

| Field | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Domain** | The base URL of your Shopware 6 store (e.g., `https://store.example.com`) |
| **Client ID** | Generated by your Shopware Integration |
| **Client Secret** | Generated by your Shopware Integration |

---

## Step 1 — Create an Integration in Shopware

1. Log in to your **Shopware 6 Admin Panel**.
2. Navigate to  
   **Settings → System → Integrations**.
3. Click **“Add Integration”**.
4. Enter a name such as `n8n API Integration`.
5. Enable **“Admin access”** if your workflows require full control (e.g., creating products or customers).
6. Click **Save**.

Once created, you’ll see the following credentials:
- **Access Key ID** → this is your **Client ID**
- **Secret Access Key** → this is your **Client Secret**

Copy these values securely — the secret key is visible **only once**.

---

## Step 2 — Gather Your Shopware Domain

You’ll also need your Shopware store’s public domain (base URL), for example:

`https://store.example.com`


Ensure that:
- The domain points to your active Shopware 6 installation.
- The Admin API is accessible at  
  `https://store.example.com/api`.

---

## Step 3 — Add Credentials in n8n

1. Open your **n8n** instance.
2. Go to **Credentials → + New**.
3. Search for **Shopware 6 OAuth2 API**.
4. Enter the fields:

   | Field | Example |
   |--------|----------|
   | **Domain** | `https://store.example.com` |
   | **Client ID** | `SWIAKQ7Y...` |
   | **Client Secret** | `A7S2Hn89...` |

5. Click **Test** to verify the connection.  
   If successful, you’ll see a confirmation message.

6. Save the credentials.

---

## Step 4 — Test the Credentials

To fully confirm authentication:

1. Add a new **Shopware 6 node** to your workflow.
2. Select your newly created credentials.
3. Choose a simple operation for a resource, such as:
   - **Resource:** Product  
   - **Operation:** Get Many
4. Execute the node.  
   If configured correctly, you’ll receive a list of products from your Shopware store.

## Troubleshooting Authentication

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **401 Unauthorized** | Invalid credentials or expired secret | Recreate your Integration in Shopware and update the Client ID/Secret in n8n. |
| **Connection timeout** | Incorrect domain or firewall blocking requests | Ensure the URL points to the correct store domain and the Admin API is reachable. |
| **403 Forbidden** | Integration lacks necessary permissions | Enable “Admin access” for your Shopware Integration. |
| **Invalid JSON** | Shopware API returned an unexpected format | Ensure your Shopware version is **6.6.x.x** or newer and API responses are JSON. |

---

## Next Steps

Once authentication is complete, you can start using the available resources and operations:

- [Products](../resources/products.md)  
- [Orders](../resources/orders.md)  
- [Customers](../resources/customers.md)
